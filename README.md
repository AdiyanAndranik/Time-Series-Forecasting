## Energy Consumption Forecasting with XGBoost

## Project Overview

This project develops a machine learning model to forecast hourly energy consumption (in megawatts, MW) using the PJME hourly dataset. The model leverages the XGBoost algorithm to predict energy usage based on temporal features extracted from the dataset. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
